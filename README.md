## AI Policy in the House of Representatives

The U.S. House of Representatives has recently implemented a comprehensive AI policy to modernize operations and enhance efficiency [A](https://cha.house.gov/2024/9/cha-cao-announce-house-of-representatives-ai-policy?copilot_analytics_metadata=eyJldmVudEluZm9fY2xpY2tEZXN0aW5hdGlvbiI6Imh0dHBzOlwvXC9jaGEuaG91c2UuZ292XC8yMDI0XC85XC9jaGEtY2FvLWFubm91bmNlLWhvdXNlLW9mLXJlcHJlc2VudGF0aXZlcy1haS1wb2xpY3kiLCJldmVudEluZm9fbWVzc2FnZUlkIjoiN3Q2Z0h0RFF4b0toYVVTRUV4U2FlIiwiZXZlbnRJbmZvX2NsaWNrU291cmNlIjoiY2l0YXRpb25MaW5rIiwiZXZlbnRJbmZvX2NvbnZlcnNhdGlvbklkIjoiSndmaXZ0SHh4ODlRc1Q5YmJ2WEZzIn0%3D&citationMarker=9F742443-6C92-4C44-BF58-8F5A7C53B6F1). This policy provides a framework for AI use while addressing cybersecurity risks and safeguarding sensitive information. It encourages staff to propose AI tools and ideas, fostering innovation within the legislative branch [A](https://cha.house.gov/2024/9/cha-cao-announce-house-of-representatives-ai-policy?copilot_analytics_metadata=eyJldmVudEluZm9fY2xpY2tTb3VyY2UiOiJjaXRhdGlvbkxpbmsiLCJldmVudEluZm9fY29udmVyc2F0aW9uSWQiOiJKd2ZpdnRIeHg4OVFzVDliYnZYRnMiLCJldmVudEluZm9fY2xpY2tEZXN0aW5hdGlvbiI6Imh0dHBzOlwvXC9jaGEuaG91c2UuZ292XC8yMDI0XC85XC9jaGEtY2FvLWFubm91bmNlLWhvdXNlLW9mLXJlcHJlc2VudGF0aXZlcy1haS1wb2xpY3kiLCJldmVudEluZm9fbWVzc2FnZUlkIjoiN3Q2Z0h0RFF4b0toYVVTRUV4U2FlIn0%3D&citationMarker=9F742443-6C92-4C44-BF58-8F5A7C53B6F1).

Additionally, the House has established a Bipartisan Task Force on Artificial Intelligence to explore AI's transformative potential and ensure responsible adoption [B](https://science.house.gov/2024/12/house-bipartisan-task-force-on-artificial-intelligence-delivers-report?copilot_analytics_metadata=eyJldmVudEluZm9fY2xpY2tTb3VyY2UiOiJjaXRhdGlvbkxpbmsiLCJldmVudEluZm9fY29udmVyc2F0aW9uSWQiOiJKd2ZpdnRIeHg4OVFzVDliYnZYRnMiLCJldmVudEluZm9fbWVzc2FnZUlkIjoiN3Q2Z0h0RFF4b0toYVVTRUV4U2FlIiwiZXZlbnRJbmZvX2NsaWNrRGVzdGluYXRpb24iOiJodHRwczpcL1wvc2NpZW5jZS5ob3VzZS5nb3ZcLzIwMjRcLzEyXC9ob3VzZS1iaXBhcnRpc2FuLXRhc2stZm9yY2Utb24tYXJ0aWZpY2lhbC1pbnRlbGxpZ2VuY2UtZGVsaXZlcnMtcmVwb3J0In0%3D&citationMarker=9F742443-6C92-4C44-BF58-8F5A7C53B6F1).
